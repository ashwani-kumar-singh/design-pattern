/**
 * Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without
 * making your code dependent on their classes.
 *
 * Problem :
 * 1. some of the objectâ€™s fields and getter method may be private and not visible from outside of
 * the object itself.
 * 2. Sometimes you only know the interface that the object follows, but not its concrete class.
